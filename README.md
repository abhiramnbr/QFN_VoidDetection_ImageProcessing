# QFN_VoidDetection_ImageProcessing
One can use this repository to extract the void data from a QFN 48pin component. The inputs would be a mask file of the same category of component. Most of the operations are automated and does not need any user intervention. 
A different file called gui.py is added where there is a Graphical user interface built maintaining the same operations as before.
